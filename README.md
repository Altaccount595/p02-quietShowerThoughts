We are working on recreating a simplified version of geography games like Globle. Our project involves selecting a random country using an API. The user enters their guess, and we use a distance API to calculate how far their guess is from the target country, providing this information as feedback. The user can then make additional guesses, repeating the process until they identify the correct country. To make the game more engaging, we plan to include optional hints, such as the country’s flag, a geographical map, a photo of the country retrieved via an API, or the first letter of the country’s name.
